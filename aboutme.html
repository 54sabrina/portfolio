  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> About Me </h2>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Bio </h2>
        <center> <p1 style="text-align:center;"> Born: USA, Ethncity: Bengali, Age:16 High School: Academy of information Technology and Engineering, 2015-2019 </p1> </center>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/11/17 </h2>
        <center> <p2 style="text-align:center;"> Some similarities of Python and Scratch are that they both require coding to make the function happen. And a difference between the two is that Scratch has blocks that let you to create the function, whereas Python, you would need to type out the code. </p2> </center>
        <center> <p3 style="text-align:center;"> When I had to debug the programs, it was a bit hard. </p3> </center>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/17/17 </h2> 
        <center> <p4 style="text-align:center;"> My idea of robots changed today after we started to really work with functions of the robots. Also on how when we worked together to make the robot work was something that changed my persepective on how robots are coded. I'm mostly excited for the future of robotics in how they can help with future security and evenutally save lives. I was a bit nervous on how today was going to go, but after that nice motavtional speech that nick, allison, hanna, and joe gave it brightened up my mood. </p4> </center>
        <center> <p5 style="text-align:center;"> I liked how that in my group everyone got along and everyone was working together. I also liked how we each had a task to do one thing while doing our project. Next time I just hope that when we get to the solution of something, that we know how we got there. </p5> </center>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/20/17 </h2>
        <center> <p6 style="text-align:center;"> Today we learned how to code our robot and to make it escape but had many times that it wouldn't work. But we got it to work at the end by attaching the servo to the code. </p6> </center>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/24/17 </h2>
        <center> <p7 style="text-align:center;"> I learned that without the client telling the computer what to do, the computer won't function. I think that LaTex is a mark up language because it doesn't need to have a program telling what it must do or say. </p7> </center>
       
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/25/17 </h2>
        <center> <p8 style="text-align:center;"> What about the Django framework do you feel confident that you understand? </p8> </center>
        <center> <p9 style="text-align:center;"> I feel comfortable understanding how the basics work but not that much at the same time. </p9> </center>
        <center> <p10 style="text-align:center;"> What did you not understand at all? </p10> <center>
        <center> <p11 style="text-align:center;"> I didn't understand the difficult parts, which was like half of the tutorial. </p11> </center>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/26/17 </h2>
        <center> <p12 style="text-align:center;"> What dynamic feature would you like to learn about next? </p12> </center>
        <center> <p13 style="text-align:center;"> I would like to learn how to make things move on your website like a flower moving across your screen evertime you press on a button. </p13> </center>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/28/17 </h2>      
        <center> <p14 style="text-align:center;"> Computers are good at data because they can organize lists and instructions needed. You should use a dictionary instead of a list because in a dictionary you can have the value of what they items are, whereas lists you get a list. The similarites of these 2 are that they both give out an organized but they are different because dictionary gives out values whereas lists gives out a list. </p14> </center>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Reflection 07/31/17 </h2>
        <center> <p15 style="text-align:center;"> I am most proud of how bubblesort works and the coding. I was most interested in my groups topic on ray tracing algorithm and I liked it because I understood how it works by watching disney videos. Also because it's basically was like how a human eye works. Today I learned algorithms are more fun than logarithms. </p15> </center>
 
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Introduction: Responding to the following questions on your blog 08/02/17: </h2>
        <center> <p16 style="text-align:center;"> What were some of the limitations of your social network program from yesterday? </p16> </center>
        <center> <p17 style="text-align:center;"> Some limitations were that we had some trouble on how to make our alexa to stop saying the same thing over and over again after we were done talking to her. I say that this was our limitation because we had little ofunderstanding when we were starting how to make it work, but after we had figured out how to make it stop, we got everything else to just fall into place. </p17> </center>
        <center> <p18 style="text-align:center;"> What features would be useful and/or interesting to add? </p18>
        <center> <p19 style="text-align:center;"> I think that our feature that we did would be interesting just to have a game to play when you get bored. </p19> </center>
