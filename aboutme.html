    <p2 style="text-align:center;"> Some similarities of Python and Scratch are that they both require coding to make the function happen. And a difference between the two is that Scratch has blocks that let you to create the function, whereas Python, you would need to type out the code. </p2>
    <p3 style="text-align:center;"> When I had to debug the programs, it was a bit hard. </p3>

      <p4 style="text-align:center;"> My idea of robots changed today after we started to really work with functions of the robots. Also on how when we worked together to make the robot work was something that changed my persepective on how robots are coded. I'm mostly excited for the future of robotics in how they can help with future security and evenutally save lives. I was a bit nervous on how today was going to go, but after that nice motavtional speech that nick, allison, hanna, and joe gave it brightened up my mood. </p4>
      <p5 style="text-align:center;"> I liked how that in my group everyone got along and everyone was working together. I also liked how we each had a task to do one thing while doing our project. Next time I just hope that when we get to the solution of something, that we know how we got there. </p5>

      <p6 style="text-align:center;"> Today we learned how to code our robot and to make it escape but had many times that it wouldn't work. But we got it to work at the end by attaching the servo to the code. </p6>
